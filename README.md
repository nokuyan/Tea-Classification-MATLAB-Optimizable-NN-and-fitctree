# Matlab-Optimize-Neural-Network-and-fitctree-Predictor-Importance
This study shows the classification of volatile compounds of different teas with high accuracy by selecting the best classifier features with a decision tree and using optimized artificial neural networks.
There are two machine learning models within MATLAB. These include:
1. Decision tree for multiclass classification
2. Optimizable Neural Network

This example shows that decision trees can be successful in feature selection used for artificial neural networks.

Requirements
The example requires MATLAB R2023b or later to be installed.
