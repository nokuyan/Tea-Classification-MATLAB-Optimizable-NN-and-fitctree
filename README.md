# Matlab-Optimize-Neural-Network-and-fitctree-Predictor-Importance
This study shows the classification of volatile compounds of different teas with high accuracy by selecting the best classifier features with a decision tree and using optimizable neural networks.
There are two machine learning models within MATLAB. These include:
1. Unsupervised Anomaly Detection / Robust Random Cut Forest
2. Multidimensional scaling (Ballabio, 2015)
3. Decision tree for multiclass classification
4. Optimizable Neural Network

This example shows that decision trees can be successful in feature selection used for optimizable neural networks.

Requirements
The example requires MATLAB R2024b or later to be installed.
